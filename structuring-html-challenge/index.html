            <p>
                Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it
                would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
                whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or
                an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other
                like-minded people.
            </p>

            <p>
                So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and
                get out into the great outdoors!
